UNILINK

Unilink.eus is a prototype job and internship search website for the University of the Basque Country. Professors and companies could upload job opportunities or projects and students could apply for that job.
The Unilik.eus server and database were hosted on Amazon Web Services EC3 and MySQL but it was a prototype, so it is no longer in operation.

UNILINK.eus was designed and programmed by a team of 4 people formed by Iker Alcorta, Irati Bilbao, Telmo Isasi and Nerea Gim√©nez.
